# SteriScout: Remote-Controlled Bot for Monitoring Patient Vitals
SteriScout is an innovative, sensor-integrated robotic solution designed to help healthcare professionals monitor critical patient vitals such as body temperature and SpO2 remotely, minimizing the need for physical presence and reducing the risk of exposure. By combining advanced sensor technology with a remote-controlled bot, SteriScout allows doctors to efficiently track patient health metrics in real time, promoting safer healthcare environments.

Features üåü
Remote Monitoring: Allows healthcare professionals to monitor body temperature and SpO2 levels from a safe distance.
Real-Time Data: Provides real-time readings and updates of patient vitals.
Sensor Integration: Utilizes precise sensors for accurate measurement of body temperature and SpO2.
Reduced Physical Contact: Minimizes the need for doctors and healthcare staff to be physically close to patients, improving safety.
Ease of Control: The bot can be remotely controlled, offering flexibility in monitoring multiple patients from a central location.
System Components üîß
Sensors: Body temperature and SpO2 sensors for real-time monitoring.
Microcontroller: A microcontroller (such as ESP32 or Arduino) to handle data processing and bot control.
Motors & Wheels: For mobility, enabling the bot to move around and reach patients.
Wireless Communication: Wireless modules (e.g., WiFi/Bluetooth) for remote control and data transmission.
Software Interface: A user interface for doctors to view patient vitals and control the bot remotely.
How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è
Data Collection: The sensors on SteriScout continuously monitor the patient‚Äôs body temperature and SpO2 levels.
Data Transmission: Patient data is sent wirelessly to the doctor's interface in real time.
Remote Control: The bot is remotely controlled by the doctor to move and monitor multiple patients from a safe distance.

SteriScout brings a revolutionary approach to healthcare, enabling safe, efficient, and remote monitoring of patients in clinical environments. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
